VirtualGamePad lets you use your Android phone as a gamepad for your Windows PC.  
Itâ€™s similar to paid apps like DroidJoy, but free and open source.

Benefits of using VirtualGamePad:

- **Free and Open Source**: No ads, no tracking, no paywalls.
- **Secure**: The code is open for anyone to review. No need to trust a random app from who-knows-where.
- **Easy to Use**: Just install the app on your phone and the server on your PC. Connect via Wi-Fi and enjoy!
- **Economical & Eco-friendly**: No need to buy a new gamepad. Use your old phone instead. Save money and reduce e-waste.
